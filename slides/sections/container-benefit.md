Note:

ACCELERATE DEVELOPERS

Stop wasting hours setting up developer environments, spinning up new instances, and making copies of production code to run locally. With Docker, you simply take copies of your live environment and run them on any new endpoint running a Docker engine.

EMPOWER CREATIVITY

The isolation capabilities of Docker containers free developers from constraints: they can use the best language and tools for their application services without worrying about causing internal tooling conflicts.

ELIMINATE ENVIRONMENT INCONSISTENCIES

Packaging an application in a container with its configs and dependencies guarantees that the application will always work as designed in any environment: locally, on another machine, in test or production. No more worries about having to install the same configurations into different environments.
